### ðŸ¥‡Simulation project in R ðŸ¥‡
<br>
In this project we were asked to investigate the activity of a hairdresser, and to examine possible ways of streamlining processes in a hairdresser. We received a budget of 20,000 NIS and a number of possible changes to make, we examined 2 different alternatives that included one or more changes.<br><br>

**For system modeling we used the R-Studio software and the Markdown tool.** Indices according to which we examined the improvement of the system in accordance with the project objectives. The average stay in the queue is 43.793 minutes, and the percentage of customers who have completed the haircut is 10.19%.
In the second alternative we decided to add another working day a week (causes a 20% reduction in the number of customers who come to the hairdresser) and add a drying machine.
We compared the alternatives using a paired t test.
<br><br>
In summary, for the average queue length index for a haircut position - alternative 1 is preferable, for the average queue time index - alternative 2 and an existing situation are a priority. And for the percentage of customers who finished their haircut on the day - alternative 2 and alternative 1 are a priority.
